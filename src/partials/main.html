        <div class="lore-wrapper">
            <p>Somewhere far beyond the ordinary fields lies a farm that wakes only under the glow of a crooked, orange moon. The
            vegetables grown here are unlike any others — these veggies are up to no good - they're restless and honestly? They've
            been plotting something big. They remember every harvest, every slice, every soup they were tossed into… and they are
            done being victims.</p>
            <p>Tonight, their rebellion returns as they gather around the ancient metal watering can — a relic said to carry a curse
            strong enough to twist nature itself.</p>

        <p class="awakening-text">As the moon climbs, the cursed can rattles to life. The thing starts glowing this weird orange light that spreads across
        the whole field, and suddenly all the plants are stirring like they just woke up from a really bad dream. Get close
        enough to that cursed can (if you've got the guts) and all hell breaks loose - the veggies go absolutely nuts and start
        throwing around some pretty wild surprises.A special “Cursed Can feature” lets you leap straight into the thick of the
        vegetable uprising — cut to the chase and jump right into the chaos.</p>

        <p>Weird stuff just happens out of nowhere while you're playing - could be during a regular spin or right in the middle of
        total chaos. One, two, or even three reels are suddenly chosen by the curse, glowing brightly as they lock into place.</p>
        <p>Then BAM - this massive, angry veggie just shows up and takes over the whole damn reel. Once the remaining reels settle,
        your harvest for that round is finalized.</p>
