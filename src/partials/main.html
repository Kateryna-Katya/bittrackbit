        <div class="lore-wrapper">
            <p>Somewhere far beyond the ordinary fields lies a farm that wakes only under the glow of a crooked, orange moon. The
            vegetables grown here are unlike any others — these veggies are up to no good - they're restless and honestly? They've
            been plotting something big. They remember every harvest, every slice, every soup they were tossed into… and they are
            done being victims.</p>
            <p>Tonight, their rebellion returns as they gather around the ancient metal watering can — a relic said to carry a curse
            strong enough to twist nature itself.</p>
